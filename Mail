Subject: Permission to wear casual shoes today

Hi [HR's Name],

I came straight from my hometown to the office today and didn’t get a chance to bring my formal shoes. Could you please allow me to wear casual shoes just for today? I’ll make sure to follow the dress code from tomorrow onwards.

Thanks for understanding.
